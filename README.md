# sveltekit-example-with-docker

Example of a SvelteKit project with Docker using the node adapter.

This repository is a reference for having an optimised Dockerfile setup for a Sveltekit project. For information about SvelteKit itself, refer to the [official documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs).

The project is bootstrapped with the create-svelte template and later the files are added to run the project with Docker using the node adapter.

The main files to look at are:
- [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)
- [.dockerignore](.dockerignore)
